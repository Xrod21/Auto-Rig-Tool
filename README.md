# Auto-Rig-Tool
Before You Use:
	Place the "Autorig" files into your documents -> maya -> "year being used" -> scripts folder
	Do not make a folder for these files, doing so will prevent the files from being read properly and as a result you won't be able to use the tool
	Run the "xr_AutoRigTool" file in Maya to launch the Auto-Rig UI
